    AUTHOR
    
    David H. Munro wrote Yorick and Gist.  Berkeley Yacc (byacc) generated
    the Yorick parser.  The routines in Math are from LAPACK and FFTPACK;
    MathC contains C translations by David H. Munro.  The algorithms for
    Yorick's random number generator and several special functions in
    Yorick/include were taken from Numerical Recipes by Press, et. al.,
    although the Yorick implementations are unrelated to those in
    Numerical Recipes.  A small amount of code in Gist was adapted from
    the X11R4 release, copyright M.I.T. -- the complete copyright notice
    may be found in the (unused) file Gist/host.c.

Full text of Eclipse Public License follows:

    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE 
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE 
    PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
    
    1. DEFINITIONS
    
    "Contribution" means:
    
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation 
    distributed under this Agreement, and
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
    
    i) changes to the Program, and
    
    ii) additions to the Program;
    
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are 
    distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' 
    from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself 
    or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include 
    additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software 
    distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license 
    agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
    
    "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
    
    "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are 
    necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when 
    combined with the Program.
    
    "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
    Agreement.
    
    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, 
    including all Contributors.
    
    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
    
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to 
    reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
    distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, 
    and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
    
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under 
    Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise 
    transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and 
    object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of 
    the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added 
    by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such 
    combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall 
    not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No 
    hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
    
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses 
    to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any 
    Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other 
    intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims 
    any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on 
    infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to 
    exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby 
    assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights 
    needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to 
    allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility 
    to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
    
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license 
    set forth in this Agreement.
    
    3. REQUIREMENTS
    
    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under 
    its own license agreement, provided that:
    
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
    
    b) its license agreement:
    
    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
    conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title 
    and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability 
    and fitness for a particular purpose;
    
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for 
    damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential 
    damages, such as lost profits;
    
    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered 
    by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
    
    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on 
    or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
    
    When the Program is made available in source code form:
    
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
    
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
    
    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within 
    the Program.
    
    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, 
    if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify 
    the originator of the Contribution.
    
    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
    
    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with 
    respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is 
    intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who 
    includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner 
    which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, 
    if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such 
    Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify 
    every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, 
    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and 
    other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified 
    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial 
    Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial 
    product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims 
    or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property 
    infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: 
    a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and 
    b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
    Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
    negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim 
    at its own expense.
    
    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product 
    offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If 
    that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers 
    warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are 
    such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the 
    Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other 
    Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a 
    court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the 
    Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
    
    5. NO WARRANTY
    
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON 
    AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR 
    CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A 
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the 
    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all 
    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , 
    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, 
    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or 
    equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
    
    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
    
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY 
    CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
    SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION 
    LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN 
    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) 
    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE 
    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE 
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    7. GENERAL
    
    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the 
    remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by 
    the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent 
    necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    
    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a 
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself 
    (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) 
    infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted 
    under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
    
    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to 
    comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and 
    does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming 
    aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement 
    terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as 
    soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this 
    Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program 
    shall continue and survive.
    
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but 
    in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only 
    be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the 
    right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from 
    time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to 
    modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement 
    Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as 
    the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of 
    the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program 
    (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version 
    of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new 
    version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute 
    the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as 
    expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no 
    rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under 
    this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. 
    All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are 
    reserved.
    
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the 
    intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to 
    this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than 
    one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to 
    a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
